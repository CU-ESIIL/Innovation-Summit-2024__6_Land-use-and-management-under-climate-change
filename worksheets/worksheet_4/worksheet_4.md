- **What are you thinking about doing next with your team? Long-term, short-term?**
    - [Short Term:] Add more data, continue to clean, and produce final dataset
    - [Long Term:] Continue to meet as a group, ideally produce a paper. 
      
- **Whatâ€™s missing: what resources, people, data sets, etc. does your team need?**
    - Adding data and other variables:
      -- social data: income, other vulnerability indices vs raw data
      -- ecological data: NDVI, ET, VPD, etc

### Reminder
There is the opportunity for groups to continue working on their projects as an ESIIL Working Group. If you love your team and want to continue working together, considering submitting a Working Group Application this fall. See the ESIIL website for more information: <https://esiil.org/working-groups>.

**Thank you for participating in the 2024 ESIIL Innovation Summit!!**
